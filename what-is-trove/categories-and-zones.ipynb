    "Trove’s resources are divided into **categories**. Understanding the nature and content of these categories will help you construct effective searches and access useful data.\n",

    "- Books & Libraries\n",

    "On the surface they seem to based on the format of resources – books in one category, newspapers in another. But it’s a bit more complicated than that. Categories are determined by the format of a resource, the source of data about the resource, and the way that data is managed within Trove. For example, newspaper articles are obviously in the Newspapers category, but part of the reason is that newspaper articles are added, described, and managed within their own separate system.\n",

    "Ever wondered why the *Australian Women’s Weekly* is found in the Newspapers category and not with the Magazines? It’s because when the Women’s Weekly was digitised, the only way for Trove to ingest digitised publications was through the newspapers pipeline. Comparable systems for managing magazines, journals, books, images, and other digitised content came later. \n",

    "## All categories are not the same\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadly speaking, there are two types of categories in Trove: those that aggregate content, in various formats, from range of organisations and sources; and those that are limited to a specific type of resource created or managed by the NLA.\n",
    "\n",
    "Categories that contain aggregated content in a variety of formats:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Books & Libraries\n",
    "- Diaries, Letters &  Archives\n",
    "- Images, Maps & Artefacts\n",
    "- Music, Audio & Video\n",
    "- Research & Reports\n",
    "\n",
    "Categories limited to a specific type of resource:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lists – created by Trove users\n",
    "- Magazines & Newsletters – digitised periodical articles\n",
    "- Newspapers & Gazettes – digitised newspapers\n",
    "- People & Organisations – identity records\n",
    "- Websites ­– archived copies of born-digital resources\n",
    "\n",
    "Trove being Trove, this distinction is not always clear cut. While newspapers and periodical articles have their own dedicated categories, the rest of the NLA's digitised content (books, maps, photographs etc) are lumped into the general resource pool. The **Magazines & Newsletters** category *almost* exclusively contains articles from periodicals digitised by the NLA, but if you [search for `NOT \"nla.obj\"`](https://trove.nla.gov.au/search/category/magazines?keyword=NOT%20%22nla.obj%22) you'll find a small amount of content from other sources – mostly issues of the *Tattersall's Club Magazine*. And while the 'People & Organisations' category only contains identity records minted by the NLA, these records aggregate and disambiguate data from a number of other sources. Nonetheless, the distinction mostly holds, and it's useful to keep in mind when you start exploring how categories actually work in Trove."

    "## Contexts not collections\n",
    "\n",
    "The categories that contain a specific type of resource, such as **Newspapers & Gazettes**, are relatively easy to understand – they operate as distinct collections with clear boundaries. But the categories that contain aggregated content are more complicated, and sometimes confusing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing to note is that individual resources can appear in more than one of these categories. For example, if you search for [\"Tasmanian Mineral Chart Series\"](https://trove.nla.gov.au/search?keyword=title%3A%22Tasmania%20mineral%20chart%20series%22) you'll be presented with the same set of results in both the **Research & Reports** and **Images, Maps & Artefacts** categories. Why does this happen? The clue is in the formats of the matched resources – all of them are described both as `Map` and `Government publication`. Unsuprisingly, resources with the format `Map` end up in the **Images, Maps & Artefacts** category. But those described as `Government publication` are routed to **Research & Reports**. Rather than choosing between competing categories, Trove adds them to both.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, a [search for the book *Atlas of Australia with all the gold regions*](https://trove.nla.gov.au/search?keyword=title%3A%22Atlas%20of%20Australia%20with%20all%20the%20gold%20regions%22) returns five results in **Books & Libraries**, with three of those results duplicated in **Images, Maps & Artefacts**. All of them have the format `Book`, but the three in **Images, Maps & Artefacts** also have the format `Map`.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many examples where resources have multiple, competing formats: \n",
    "\n",
    "- 3,000 resources are both `Book` (Books & Libraries) and `Art work` (Images, Maps & Artefacts)\n",
    "- 22,000 resources are `Government publication` (Research & Reports) and `Video` (Music, Audio & Video)\n",
    "- 1,000 resources are `Object` (Images, Maps & Artefacts) and `Unpublished` (Diaries, Letters &  Archives)\n",
    "\n",
    "These overlaps become even more complex when mixed with Trove's [grouping of works and versions](works-and-versions).\n",
    "\n",
    "By duplicating results across categories, Trove is trying to make these resources easier to find, and that's good! The problem really is with the *idea* of 'categories'. Until 2020, Trove's categories were called 'zones', but during the initial design process they were referred to as 'collection views'.{cite:p}`cathroDevelopingTrovePolicy2010` The 'collection view' label provides a much clearer indication of the purpose of these top-level groupings – **they're not collections, they're contexts for discovery**.\n",
    "\n",
    "They key point is that aggregated resources don't really *belong* to a category. You might have noticed that individual work records in both the web interface and the API, don't tell you the category (or categories) that work belongs to. If you have a work record, the only way to find its associated categories is to run a search for it. Categories only make sense when you're searching. They're not buckets of content, they're windows onto a big pool of aggregated resources.\n",
