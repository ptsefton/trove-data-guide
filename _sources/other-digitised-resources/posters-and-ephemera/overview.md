`series:"Australian ephemera collection (General)"` 

<https://trove.nla.gov.au/search?keyword=series%3A%22Australian%20ephemera%20collection%20%28General%29%22>

even better just `series:ephemera` across all categories

<https://trove.nla.gov.au/search/category/correspondence?keyword=series%3Aephemera>
