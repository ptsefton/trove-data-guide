Still much harder than it should be (except for `magazine` & `newspaper` categories of course).

Various combinations of:

- searching for "nla.obj"
- `nuc:"ANL:TDL"`
- NOT `nuc:"ANL:NED"`?
- `fullTextInd:y` (not just NLA, not always accessible)
- `l-availability` -- to get what's online
- `has:correctabletext`

Need to test these combinations to see what works...

```{code-cell} ipython3
