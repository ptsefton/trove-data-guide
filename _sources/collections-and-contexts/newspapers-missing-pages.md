# Missing newspaper pages and issues

+++ {"editable": true, "slideshow": {"slide_type": ""}}

```{attention}
This guide is currently under development. For more information and discussion see [the list of issues](https://github.com/wragge/trove-data-guide/issues) on GitHub. Comments are welcome.

This section will attempt some analysis of missing pages and issues in Trove's newspapers. As of 11 August 2023, I'm running a very long harvest of essentially every article in Trove to try and get an idea of what's missing. This will never be precise, but it should at least provide a baseline and point to specific titles and periods that seem to be more affected.

Here's a [quick example using the Canberra Times](https://hcommons.social/@wragge/110845292959103039).

Here's an issue that seems to have a lot of missing pages, but is actually out of order: <https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-issue2584973>
