    "Some newspapers include supplements that have their own independent pagination. This means, for example, that an issue could contain multiple pages numbered `1`. The `firstpageseq` index searches *both* the main body of the newspaper *and* any supplements, so the results could include articles published on more than one page within an issue. There's no way of searching just in the main body or in supplements, but you can filter the results after you've retrieved them from the API. Article results include fields labelled `page` and `pageSequence`. The `page` field contains just numbers, but if the page comes from a supplement, the `pageSequence` field will include an `S` after the number. You can use this to keep or discard articles from supplements. [](get-page-identifier-from-search) provides an example of filtering results using the `pageSequence` value.\n",
