    "- Discovery versus analysis – need to recognise that the aim of the search indexing is to present the user with items that *could be* of relevance, but this fuzziness might limit the usefulness of search results for analysis. Eg: user-added tags and comments are searched by default. Examine relevance ranking.\n",
