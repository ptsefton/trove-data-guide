# HOW TO: Get a newspaper issue or article as a PDF

You can download PDFs of newspaper and gazette articles, pages, and issues from Trove's web interface â€“ it's just a matter of clicking a button. But downloading PDFs using computational methods is not so straightforward. When you click on the buttons in the web interface, you don't download the PDF from a fixed url. There's a bit of Javascript code behind the button that asks for for the PDF to be compiled, then alerts the user when it's ready. To automate the download process, you need to reproduce these steps in your code. This how-to provides an example of how this can be done using Python.

```{admonition} But what about pages?
:class: note
Newspaper and gazette *pages* are treated slightly differently to articles and issues. If you know the page identifier, you can construct a url that will download that page as a PDF without any waiting!

    If a 200 status code is received, return True.

## Get a PDF of an issue

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Set issue id -- in practice, this would probably be in a loop, accessing a list of issues
issue_id = "424530"

# Get the PDF url
pdf_url = get_pdf_url(issue_id, "issue")

# Download and save the PDF
response = requests.get(pdf_url)
Path(f"issue-{issue_id}.pdf").write_bytes(response.content)
```

## Get a PDF of an article

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Set article id -- in practice, this would probably be in a loop, accessing a list of articles
article_id = "61389505"

# Get the PDF url
pdf_url = get_pdf_url(article_id, "article")

# Download and save the PDF
response = requests.get(pdf_url)
Path(f"article-{article_id}.pdf").write_bytes(response.content)
```
