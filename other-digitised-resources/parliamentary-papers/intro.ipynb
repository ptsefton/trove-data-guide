If you look at the results in the **Magazines & Newsletters** category, you'll see that the records describe *sections* of Parliamentary Papers, not complete publications. In other words, **the Parliamentary Papers are being treated like issues of a periodical** – the contents of each paper is being split up into sections, and a record is being created for each individual section.\n",

If you add `NOT format:Article` to your search you'll exclude reports with the format `Article/Report`, and probably lose other publications that are grouped with `Article` records. You could just ignore the **Magazines & Newsletters** category, but many of the 'articles' are also in **Research & Reports** where they're mixed with other publication formats. There's no way to drop the 'articles' without losing other, more relevant, records.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a dataset that only contains details of complete Parliamentary Papers, you need to harvest metadata from the search above, and then inspect the details of each record to exclude the ones you don't want.

    "As noted above, individual Parliamentary Papers are often treated as issues of a periodical. But not always. Sometimes they are described as standalone works. This [report by the Australian Science and Technology Council on 'Marine sciences and technologies in Australia'](https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/9710970?) is treated like a book, and is linked to a single digitised resource. It might have been grouped with a [follow-up report from the next year](https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/9988298), but it doesn't really matter as they're both easily discoverable.\n",
    "\n",
    "[](/what-is-trove/collections) outlines the different ways Trove tries to represent collections of resources. Where Parliamentary Papers are grouped together as 'issues', they're generally created as collections within the digitised item viewer. For example, the work record for [Report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation](https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/22095680) links to a page with a **Browse this collection** button. Clicking on the button displays details of 28 different reports published between 1992 and 2001.\n",

So the digitised version of the 1993 report on the *Super Complaints Tribunal* can be accessed directly from [this work record](https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/237349942), or by using the **Browse this collection** page.\n",

The report on the *Super Complaints Tribunal*, for example, actually has the title 'PP no. 388 of 1993, Report no. 10', and so won't be returned by a title search for 'super complaints tribunal'. Added to that, there are a large number of duplicate records. \n",
