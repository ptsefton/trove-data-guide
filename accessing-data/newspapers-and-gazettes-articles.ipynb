You can [add items](https://www.zotero.org/support/adding_items_to_zotero) by clicking on the Zotero icon in your web browser. The translator extracts metadata from the article web page and citation, rather than the Trove API.\n",

    "For example, Zotero's built-in PDF viewer enables you to select sections of newspaper articles for annotation. You could use this to manually highlight sections of interest in long newspaper articles.

You could use this information to crop an image of the OCRd text out of the parent image.
