    "One confusing, and often frustrating, aspect of image downloads is their resolution. You can use the Trove image viewer to zoom right in to many photographs and manuscripts, enabling you to pick up fine details. But if you download the same image, you could find the resolution is much lower. This means you're limited in how you can use the downloaded image. The available resolutions vary across categories and formats, and you really don't know what you'll get until you download it. Many manuscripts, in particular, seem to have low-resolution downloads, which doesn't help you much when you're trying to decipher someone's handwriting! But never fear, there are a [few hacks and work arounds](/how-to/web-interface/download-higher-resolution-images) you can try to get higher resolution versions.\n",
