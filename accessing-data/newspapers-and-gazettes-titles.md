## What's a title?

'Titles' in this context refers to the names and details of the publications whose articles are digitised in Trove's *Newspapers & Gazette's* category. For example: *Canberra Times*, *Sydney Morning Herald*, or *Commonwealth of Australia Gazette*.

(title-links-and-identifiers)=
## Title links and identifiers

Every title in Trove's *Newspapers & Gazette's* category has it's own unique identifier. You can find this identifier in the web interface and by using the Trove API.

You can browse a full list of titles in the web interface. Click on the ðŸ›ˆ icon next to a title's name to open its landing page.

```{figure} /images/title-browse-link.png
:name: title-browse-link
:width: 500
Click on the ðŸ›ˆ icon to open a title's landing page
```

If you're viewing an article, you can get to the title's landing page by hovering over the title in the breadcrumbs, and clicking on the 'View title info' link.

```{figure} /images/newspaper-title-link.png
:name: title-article-link
:width: 500
Hover over the breadcrumbs to reveal a link to the title's landing page
```

The identifier is displayed on the title's landing page and has the form: `http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-title1406`. 

```{figure} /images/trove-title-id.png
:name: title-id
:width: 500
The title's identifier is displayed on the landing page
```

If you load the identifier in your web browser, you'll be redirected to the landing page. You'll notice that the numeric part of the identifier is also in the url of the landing page.

You can access identifiers for all titles from the `/newspaper/titles` and `/gazette/titles` endpoints. You can also find them in the `title` field of an article record. For example:

```json
"title": {
    "id": "1406",
    "title": "Daily Advertiser (Geraldton, WA : 1890 - 1893)"
},
```

The `title["id"]` field contains the title's numeric identifier. By appending it to `http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-title` you can create a link to the title's landing page, or by using it with the `/newspaper/title` endpoint you can download the title's metadata from the Trove API.

### Get a list of newspaper & gazette titles

You can get information about newspaper and gazette titles in Trove from these API endpoints:

- `newspaper/titles` â€“ [![Try it!](../images/try-trove-api-console.svg)
](https://troveconsole.herokuapp.com/v3/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.trove.nla.gov.au%2Fv3%2Fnewspaper%2Ftitles%3Fencoding%3Djson)
- `gazette/titles` â€“ [![Try it!](../images/try-trove-api-console.svg)
](https://troveconsole.herokuapp.com/v3/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.trove.nla.gov.au%2Fv3%2Fgazette%2Ftitles%3Fencoding%3Djson)

The data isn't paginated, so you get all the titles at once. Here's a basic example showing how to get a list of all the titles from the `newspaper/titles` endpoint.

```{code-cell} ipython3
---
editable: true
slideshow:
  slide_type: ''
---
import requests

# Set encoding parameter to JSON
params = {"encoding": "json"}

# Supply API key using headers
headers = {"X-API-KEY": YOUR_API_KEY}

# Make the request
response = requests.get(
    "https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/titles", params=params, headers=headers
)

# Get the JSON data from the response
data = response.json()

# Get the list of newspapers
newspapers = data["newspaper"]

# Display the first title in the list
newspapers[0]
```

+++ {"editable": true, "slideshow": {"slide_type": ""}}

### How many newspaper titles are there?

The responses you get back from the `newspaper/titles` or `gazette/titles` endpoints includes a `total` value that tells you the number of titles matching your request. Reusing the data from the request above, we can get the total number of newspaper titles like this:

```{code-cell} ipython3
---
editable: true
slideshow:
  slide_type: ''
---
data["total"]
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
---
editable: true
slideshow:
  slide_type: ''
tags: [remove-cell]
---
newspapers_df = pd.DataFrame(newspapers)
chart = (
    alt.Chart(newspapers_df)
    .mark_bar()
    .encode(
        x="state:N",
        y=alt.Y("count():Q", title="number of titles"),
        color=alt.Color("state:N", legend=None),
    )
    .properties(width=150)
)
glue("titles-by-state-chart", chart)
```

### Get a list of newspaper titles from a particular state

`````{margin}
````{admonition} Newspapers by state
:class: note
```{glue:} titles-by-state-chart
```
````
`````

You can filter the list of titles by adding the `state` parameter. Possible values for `state` are: 


- `nsw` â€“ [![Try it!](../images/try-trove-api-console.svg)](https://troveconsole.herokuapp.com/v3/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.trove.nla.gov.au%2Fv3%2Fnewspaper%2Ftitles%3Fstate%3Dnsw%26encoding%3Djson)

Here's an example showing how to get only newspapers published in Victoria.

```{code-cell} ipython3
---
editable: true
slideshow:
  slide_type: ''
---
# Add the state parameter and set it to 'vic' to get titles from Victoria
params = {"encoding": "json", "state": "vic"}

response = requests.get(
    "https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/titles", params=params, headers=headers
)

data = response.json()
newspapers = data["newspaper"]

# Display the first title in the list
newspapers[0]
```

### Get details of a single newspaper or gazette title

+++ {"editable": true, "slideshow": {"slide_type": ""}}

To retrieve information about an individual title, use the `newspaper/title` or `gazette/title` endpoints with a [title identifier](title-links-and-identifiers). To construct the request url, add the title's numeric identifier to the endpoint: `https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/[TITLE ID]`. For example, to request metadata about the *Canberra Times* you'd use:  `https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/11`

[![Try it!](https://troveconsole.herokuapp.com/static/img/try-trove-api-console.svg)](https://troveconsole.herokuapp.com/v3/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.trove.nla.gov.au%2Fv3%2Fnewspaper%2Ftitle%2F11%2F%3Fencoding%3Djson&comment=)

### Aggregate search results by title using the `title` facet

You can also explore the characteristics of newspaper titles in Trove by using the API's `/result` endpoint with the `title` facet.

+++ {"editable": true, "slideshow": {"slide_type": ""}}

### Find catalogue entries for newspaper titles

- use ISSNs to search in "Books & Libraries"
- note that the `issn` field in API records doesn't always contain ISSNs
- search for `format:Periodical/Newspaper`, add filters such as "nla.gov.au/nla.news" and "trove.nla.gov.au", weed out journals and eDeposit (how many are there?)
