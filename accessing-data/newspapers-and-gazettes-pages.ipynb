    "You can also get page identifiers from a search for newspaper articles using the `/result` endpoint. To find the identifier for a particular page in a particular issue, you need to specify the title (the newspaper name), the publication date, and the page number.\n",
    "\n",
    "First you need to tell the Trove API you want to search for newspaper articles. You do this by setting the `category` parameter to `newspaper`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The title is set using the `l-title` parameter. As noted above, the identifier for the *Canberra Times* is `11`, so to limit your search to the *Canberra Times* you'd set `l-title=11`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The date is set using the `date` index within the `q` (query) parameter. You use the `date` index by supplying a date range. If you want a single day, the first date in the range should be the day **before** the date you want. The dates need to be in ISO format – `YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00Z`. For example, if we wanted a page from 2 November 1942, we'd set the `q` parameter to `date:[1942-11-01T00:00:00Z TO 1942-11-02T00:00:00Z]`.\n",

    "To request a specific page number, you use the `firstpageseq` index in the `q` parameter. To find page 3, you'd add `firstpageseq:3` to the value for `q`.\n",

    "Finally, you need to add `reclevel=full` to the request. This asks for additional metadata about the article, including the url of the page. You can also add `n=1` to the request if you want. This sets the number of articles required. In this case we only need one.\n",
